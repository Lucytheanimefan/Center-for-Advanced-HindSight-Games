    <ul>
      <li>You earn 23 Francs of income per month. 8 of those go the the bowling membership (also per month). So you have 15 Francs left to go bowling.</li>

      <li>In each month, you can play 10 games of bowling. There are a total of 4 months (so 40 games total).</li>

      <li>In each game, you have 10 pins and can decide whether or not to decide to buy a ball. A ball costs 1 Franc.</li>

      <li>If you buy a ball, throwing it at the pins requires no skill. Thus, the number of pins knocked down us purely random. For each pin you knock down, you earn $xxxxx</li>

      <li>After throwing the ball, you can decide whether you want to buy another ball or proceed to the next game where there're 10 new pins lined up.</li>
